                <h2>How It All Started</h2>
                                
            Thank you for visiting my website. This website started from nothing. I started working on it in 2019. 
            <br>TevinBristol.com was originally TevinsWorld, and it was going to be a project for school. 
            <br>Year by year, I took my time working on it and decided to make this my website forever and use it for my business. 
            <br>
            <h2>What Am I </h2>
            
            I am a Computer Programmer, Web Developer, and Graphic Designer. I am currently learning HTML, PHP, CSS, Java Programming, Visual Basics, C++, and MYSQL.
            <br> I enjoy Web Developing the most. I feel like it goes hand in hand with my Creativeness when doing Graphic Design. 
            
            
            </p>
